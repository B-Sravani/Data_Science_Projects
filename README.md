# Data Science projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing a collection of exciting data science projects! As a data scientist graduate, I am passionate about exploring and analyzing data to uncover insights and make informed decisions. In this repository, you'll find a diverse range of projects that showcase my skills and expertise in data science.

Here's a brief overview of the projects you'll find in this repository:

## 1. Twitter Hate

Through the implementation of NLP techniques, the code helps to identify tweets with hate speech and remove them from the platform as well as perform specific cleaning for tweet data and build robust model.

## 2. Phishing Detector

Based on the data, the code creates a binary classification model (phishing website or not) using Python Scikit-Learn, which trains on the test data and calculates the accuracy score. To train the model on the phishing website dataset, the code uses the logistic regression classification algorithm.

## 3. California House Price Prediction

Using the dataset provided, the project aims to predict median house values in California using a model of housing prices. With all other metrics considered, this model can predict the median housing price in any district.
